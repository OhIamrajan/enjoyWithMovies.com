               <p>It may be little difficult to understand the content in this website, and you
                   may have no idea what this website is about, yet. No Problem, Obviously in
                   this site you learn how to be strange in something and how people manage to
                   be different in their character or attitude.
               </p>
               <p>First of all, why we are needed to be different among the people. Yes, exactly
                   this is not for all, and this is for someone who is affected by something
                   or he hates to be ordinary. Particularly, this helps for that person.
               </p>
               <h2>Still, i am not understand...

               </h2>
               <p>
                   You may hate it. Think about some examples. If you watched the movie named
                   Dark Knight directed by Cristopher Nolon, you know who is joker. Take that
                   as a example, look that joker is more different in his character, he robbed
                   large amount of money and eventually he burned it. You know what he gain,
                   If we look f rom our side he gains nothing, But he gains happy, thrilling while robbing
                   the money, he killed his patners, why? It may be interesting to him. I
                   am not asking you to kill someone, but be different in something especially
                   among your friends. That make you to take respect from others. Be knowledged
                   in something in which your friends have no knowledge. Acquire some skills
                   which your friends have no skill in that. In anyway, dont be silly, cause
                   that is the best spoiler of your attitude.
               </p>
               <p>Normally, most of the people listens the songs in their native language.
                   What happens if you like the song belong to another language for example
                   Spanish . Cause, spanish songs plays a vital role in youtube and most of the 
                   spanish song crossed billion views. I suggest native song lovers dont like it.
